For the final project, I would develop a web-based corpus learning tool. The learning tool will provide students with authentic data of upper-level students writing in science and engineering disciples. Especially, the learning tool will focus on learning lexico-grammatical patterns of shell nouns in science and engineering disciplines. Shell nouns are a group of semantic patterns of nouns that characterize detailed information, organize temporal concepts and link nominal information. This usage of shell nouns is pedagogically important since they function as creating lexical cohesion in the academic discourse. Students will learn the use of shell nouns based on data-driven learning pedagogy. At first, three buttons will be given on a website. Each button will drive students to each learning section. In the first section, students will type any shell nouns in a prompt with a selection of text types( methodological recount, essay, and critiques). The output will provide concordance lines of the shell nouns as a center. After that, students will be asked to input the types of determiners (these, the, this, those)  preceding the shell noun. The output will be “correct” or “. In the next section, students will analyze concordance lines and type grammatical structures that follow shell nouns (that, to-clause, V+that, and V+ to clause). In the third section, concordance lines of shell nouns will be given at the prompt and students will do multiple-choice tasks that ask students to choose the discourse functions(characterization, linking nominal information, and organizing concepts) of the shell nouns in the given context.
